# NVIDIA Optimus Linux Configuration
## HYBRID/OPTIMUS MODE
Use Optimus-Manager (in "nvidia" or "hybrid" mode) with Nvidia RTD3 runtime power management support.
To make work the "integrated" mode (for disabling the Nvidia discrete GPU), a fixed config file is available.

## DISCRETE MODE / Disconnected iGPU
Use the "11-nvidia_discrete.conf" X.org config file in this folder.
